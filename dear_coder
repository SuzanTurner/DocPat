Dear Coder,

I once faced the obliteration of a 7,000+ LOC codebase being stolen — days of work, gone in a blink.  
It taught me a hard truth: not everyone understands the value of each line.

So now, I obfuscate everything.

This code is protected for a reason.
It’s not your playground, it’s my blood and brain turned into logic.

Therefore...

DON’T.  
TOUCH.  
MY.  
CODE.
